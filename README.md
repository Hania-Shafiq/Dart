# Dart Projects

This repository contains Dart projects created while practicing Dart programming language.

## Projects:

1. **Simple calculator**: This Dart program is a simple command-line calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition,
    subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers. It prompts the user to enter the desired operation and the two numbers, validates the input,
    performs the calculation, and then displays the result. It also handles cases such as division by zero and invalid input gracefully by providing
    appropriate error messages..

6. **Password Generator**: This Dart program generates strong passwords based on user-defined criteria such as the length of numbers, lowercase letters, uppercase
    letters, and special characters. It prompts the user to input these criteria, validates the input, and then generates the specified number of passwords meeting
    the criteria.

    The generated passwords consist of a combination of numbers, lowercase and uppercase letters, and special characters, ensuring a high level of randomness and security.

    It utilizes Dart's `Random` class to generate random characters and constructs each password by concatenating characters from predefined character sets for numbers,
    lowercase and uppercase alphabets, and special characters.

   Finally, it prints each generated password on a separate line for the user to see..
